ct_auto_run <top_dir> <run_command>
-----------
Automatically runs test suites when the source files they depend on (or the
testsuites themselfes) have changed.

ct_auto_run will try to infer what modules a test suite depends on. However,
in case it is not able to do so, you can specify a test_source attribute with
the modules to watch like this:
-test_source([mod1, mod2]).

The command takes two parameters, topdir and run_command:
  top_dir is the top directory under which both test suites and source files
  can be found. This is usually an application top directory.

  run_command is the actual command used to run the tests. ct_auto_run will
  append any suites to run as arguments to this command.

Example:
ct_auto_run /home/myname/dev/erlang/my_app ct_run -config my.config -suite

Suppose that my_app contains the files src/cool.erl and test/cool_SUITE.erl.
ct_run_all will run cool_SUITE whenever cool.erl changes.

Current status:
See TODO to see what is done and what is still to be done.
